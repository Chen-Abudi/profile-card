      <p>
        <span>Aloha</span>My name is Grace Chen Abudi and I'm a Full-Stack
        Developer. I'm driven by a fervent dedication to coding, logic, art, and
        cutting-edge technology. My insatiable curiosity fuels my unyielding
        enthusiasm for delving into uncharted territories and acquiring new
        knowledge. An innate desire to assist and collaborate with other fuels
        my passion for both giving and receiving insights. Beyond my proficiency
        as a Full-Stack Developer, I find myself irresistibly drawn to the
        realms of UI/UX design, AI & 3D modeling, as well as indulging in
        pursuits such as language acquisition, dance, music, and a profound
        admiration for the wonders of nature and the ocean
